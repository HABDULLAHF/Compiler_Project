This Project details the design and implementation of a compiler for a simplified C-like 
programming language. The project encompasses defining the language's grammar using 
Context-Free Grammar (CFG) and Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation, converting the 
grammar into a finite automaton using JFLAP, and implementing the various phases of the 
compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code 
generation, code optimization, and final code generation. Each phase is meticulously designed 
to ensure the compiler efficiently translates high-level language constructs into low-level 
assembly or machine-like code. Challenges encountered during the development process, such 
as handling ambiguities in grammar and optimizing the intermediate code, are discussed in 
detail. The compiler's functionality and correctness are validated through comprehensive 
testing with diverse code snippets. This report provides an in-depth overview of the design 
decisions, implementation details, and testing methodologies, offering insights into the 
complexities and solutions involved in
